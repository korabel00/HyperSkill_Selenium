/*In the boolean logic (not Java!), Peirce's arrow (also known as NOR) is a logical operator that produces a result that
 is the negation of logical or. This operator returns true, only if both arguments are false, otherwise, it returns false.
 But Java doesn't have this operator as built-in.

        Which combination of standard Java operators has the same effect as the Peirce's arrow? (b1 and b2 are boolean
        variables). Select one or more suitable cases.*/



//!b1 && !b2

//!(b1 || b2)
